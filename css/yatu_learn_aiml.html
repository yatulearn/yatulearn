    <h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING</h1>
    <h2 class="What">What is AI and ML</h2>
    <p class="p">
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human
      intelligence in machines that are designed to think, learn, and
      problem-solve like humans. AI systems can perform tasks that typically
      require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition,
      decision-making, language translation, and more. Machine Learning (ML) is
      a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow
      computers to learn from and make decisions based on data. Instead of being
      explicitly programmed to perform a task, ML algorithms use statistical
      techniques to identify patterns in data, learn from those patterns, and
      make predictions or decisions without human intervention.
    </p>
    <h3>Types of AI</h3>
    <p class="p">
      AI can be categorized into three main types based on its capabilities
    </p>
    <h4>1. Narrow AI (Weak AI):</h4>
    <p class="p">
      * <b>Definition:</b> AI systems that are designed to perform a specific
      task or a narrow range of tasks. They are highly specialized and operate
      under a limited context. <br />
      * <b>Examples:</b> Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, recommendation
      systems on Netflix, image recognition systems, etc. <br />
      * <b>Applications</b>: Specific tasks like speech recognition, image
      classification, recommendation systems, and autonomous driving.
    </p>
    <h4>2. General AI (Strong AI):</h4>
    <p class="p">
      *<b> Definition</b>: AI systems that possess the ability to understand,
      learn, and apply intelligence across a wide range of tasks, similar to
      human cognitive abilities. <br />
      * Examples: As of now, General AI does not exist; it is a theoretical
      concept. <br />
      * Applications: If achieved, General AI would be capable of performing any
      intellectual task that a human can do.
    </p>
    <h4>3. Superintelligent AI:</h4>
    <p class="p">
      *<b>Definition</b>: A form of AI that surpasses human intelligence and
      capability in virtually every field, including creativity,
      problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. <br />
      * Examples: This is a hypothetical concept and does not currently exist.
      <br />
      * Applications: Superintelligent AI could revolutionize fields like
      medicine, science, and technology, but it also raises significant ethical
      and existential concerns.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
    <h4>ML can be broadly classified into four types:</h4>
    <h4>1. Supervised Learning:</h4>
    <p class="p">
      *<b> Definition</b>: Involves training an algorithm on a labeled dataset,
      where the correct output is known. The model learns by comparing its
      output with the correct answers and adjusting accordingly. <br />*
      Examples: Spam detection in email, sentiment analysis, predictive
      analytics. <br />* Algorithms: Linear regression, logistic regression,
      decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), neural networks.
    </p>
    <h4>2. Unsupervised Learning:</h4>
    <p class="p">
      * <b>Definition</b>: Involves training an algorithm on an unlabeled
      dataset, where the output is unknown. The model tries to find hidden
      patterns or intrinsic structures within the data. <br />
      * Examples: Market basket analysis, customer segmentation, anomaly
      detection. <br />
      * Algorithms: K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, principal
      component analysis (PCA), autoencoders.
    </p>
    <h4>3. Semi-Supervised Learning:</h4>
    <p class="p">
      <b>Definition</b>: A combination of supervised and unsupervised learning.
      The model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount
      of unlabeled data. <br />
      *Examples: Image recognition tasks where only some images are labeled.
      <br />
      *Algorithms: Semi-supervised support vector machines, transductive SVM,
      generative models.
    </p>
    <h4>4. Reinforcement Learning:</h4>
    <p class="p">
      *<b> Definition</b>: Involves training an agent to make a sequence of
      decisions by rewarding or punishing it based on its actions. The goal is
      to maximize cumulative rewards. <br />
      *Examples: Robotics, gaming (like AlphaGo), autonomous vehicles. <br />
      *Algorithms: Q-learning, deep Q-networks (DQN), policy gradients, deep
      deterministic policy gradient (DDPG).
    </p>
    <br />
