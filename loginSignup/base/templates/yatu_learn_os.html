        <h1 class="h1">What is an Operating System (OS)?</h1><br>
        <div class="content-box">
        <p class="p">
            An Operating System (OS) is the most critical software component on a computer or device, serving as an
            intermediary between the hardware and the user. It manages hardware resources, provides a user interface,
            and facilitates the execution of application software. The OS controls the way software interacts with
            hardware, ensures that processes are executed efficiently, and manages files, memory, and peripheral devices
            like printers and keyboards.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Functions of an Operating System</h2><br>

        <p class="p"><b>1. Process Management:</b>
        * The OS handles the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes. It manages CPU allocation to ensure
        that processes run smoothly without conflicts. <br>
        <b>2. Memory Management:</b>
        * The OS manages the computerâ€™s memory, allocating space for processes and ensuring that they do not interfere
        with each other. It handles memory allocation, deallocation, and swapping between RAM and disk storage.<br>
        <b>3. File System Management:</b>
        * The OS organizes and manages data on storage devices through a file system. It provides mechanisms for file
        creation, deletion, reading, and writing, as well as access control. <br>
        <b>4. Device Management:</b>
        * The OS manages input and output devices, such as keyboards, mice, printers, and storage devices. It provides
        device drivers that allow the hardware to communicate with software applications. <br>
        <b>5. Security and Access Control:</b>
        * The OS provides security mechanisms to protect the system from unauthorized access and threats. It manages
        user authentication, permissions, and encryption. <br>
        <b>6. User Interface:</b>
        * The OS offers a user interface, either command-line (CLI) or graphical (GUI), to interact with the system and
        execute commands. <br>
        <b>7. Networking:</b>
        * The OS provides networking capabilities that enable computers to communicate over a network. It handles
        network connections, data transmission, and communication protocols. <br>
        <b>8. Error Detection and Handling:</b>
        * The OS monitors the system for errors and takes appropriate actions to ensure the system remains stable and
        operational. <br>

        <b>1. Batch Operating Systems:</b>
        * Definition: In batch systems, tasks or jobs are grouped together and processed sequentially without user
        interaction. These systems were common in early computing environments where resources were scarce. <br>
        * Examples: IBM's mainframe operating systems in the 1960s. <br>
        * Characteristics: Lack of direct user interaction, jobs processed in batches, efficient resource utilization. <br>
        <b>2. Time-Sharing Operating Systems:</b>
        * Definition: Time-sharing systems allow multiple users to share system resources simultaneously. The OS
        allocates a small time slice to each user, creating the illusion of concurrency.
        <br>* Examples: Unix, Multics. <br>
        * Characteristics: Multi-user environment, fast context switching, interactive user sessions. <br>
        <b>3. Distributed Operating Systems:</b>
        * Definition: Distributed systems manage a group of independent computers that appear to the user as a single
        cohesive system. The OS coordinates the distribution of tasks across multiple machines.
        <br>* Examples: Amoeba, Plan 9.
        <br>* Characteristics: Resource sharing, parallel processing, fault tolerance. <br>
        <b>4. Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS):</b>
        * Definition: RTOS are designed for systems that require precise timing and consistent response times. They are
        used in applications where timing is critical, such as embedded systems, industrial automation, and avionics.
        <br>* Examples: VxWorks, FreeRTOS, QNX.
        <br>* Characteristics: Deterministic behavior, high reliability, low latency. <br>
        <b>5. Embedded Operating Systems:</b>
        * Definition: Embedded systems are specialized OS designed to run on embedded hardware with limited resources.
        These systems are used in devices like routers, smart appliances, and automotive systems.
        <br>* Examples: Embedded Linux, Windows Embedded, FreeRTOS.
        <br>* Characteristics: Small footprint, real-time capabilities, highly specialized.
        <br><b>6. Network Operating Systems (NOS):</b>
        * Definition: NOS are designed to manage network resources and enable communication between computers over a
        network. They provide services like file sharing, print services, and user management.
        <br>* Examples: Novell NetWare, Windows Server, Unix.
        <br>* Characteristics: Network-centric features, user and resource management, security.
        <br><b>7. Mobile Operating Systems:</b>
        * Definition: Mobile OS are designed for smartphones, tablets, and other portable devices. They are optimized
        for touch interfaces, mobile connectivity, and app ecosystems.
        <br>* Examples: Android, iOS, Windows Phone.
        <br>* Characteristics: Touch-based interface, app-centric design, energy efficiency.
        <br><b>8. Cloud Operating Systems:</b>
        * Definition: Cloud OS are designed to run and manage virtualized environments in the cloud. They provide the
        infrastructure for cloud computing, allowing users to run applications and store data over the internet.
        <br>* Examples: OpenStack, VMware vSphere.
        <br>* Characteristics: Virtualization, scalability, remote access.
        <br><b>9. General-Purpose Operating Systems:</b>
        * Definition: These OS are designed for general use and can run a wide variety of applications, making them
        suitable for desktops, laptops, and servers.
        <br>* Examples: Windows, macOS, Linux.
        <br>* Characteristics: Versatility, user-friendly interfaces, broad hardware support.
