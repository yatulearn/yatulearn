      <h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>
      <h6>...</h6>
      <h6>...</h6>
      <p class="p">
        Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across a network of computers in a way that makes it nearly impossible to alter or hack the recorded data. Each block in a blockchain contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, ensuring data integrity and security. Blockchain technology underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but its applications extend far beyond digital currencies.

      <h2>Types of Blockchain Networks</h2>
      <h6>...</h6>
      <h6>...</h6>
      <p class="p">
        Blockchain networks can be categorized based on their configuration and access control:
        <br /><br />
        <b>1. Public Blockchain:</b><br />
        * Definition: Open to anyone who wants to join and participate. These blockchains are fully decentralized, with no single entity controlling the network.
        <br />* Examples: Bitcoin, Ethereum.
        <br /><br />
        <b>2. Private Blockchain:</b><br />
        * Definition: Controlled by a single organization, where only selected participants are allowed to join and operate. Typically used for internal business processes.
        <br />* Examples: Hyperledger, Corda.
        <br /><br />
        <b>3. Consortium Blockchain:</b><br />
        * Definition: A semi-decentralized type of blockchain where multiple organizations manage the network. It is often used in industries that require collaboration between multiple parties.
        <br />* Examples: Quorum, R3.
        <br /><br />
        <b>4. Hybrid Blockchain:</b><br />
        * Definition: Combines features of both public and private blockchains, allowing for some data to be private while others remain accessible to the public.
        <br />* Examples: Dragonchain, IBM Food Trust.
