    <h1>DevOps</h1>
    <div class="content-box">
      <h2>What is DevOps?</h2>
      <p class="p">
        DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). Its goal is to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is a culture that promotes collaboration between development and operations teams to improve efficiency and productivity.
      </p>

      <h2>Why DevOps?</h2>
      <b>1. Faster Time to Market</b>:
      <p class="p">
        DevOps helps organizations deliver software faster by automating processes and enabling continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
      </p>
      <b>2. Improved Collaboration</b>:
      <p class="p">
        DevOps fosters collaboration between development, operations, and other stakeholders, leading to more efficient workflows and better communication.
      </p>
      <b>3. Enhanced Quality</b>:
      <p class="p">
        DevOps promotes automated testing, monitoring, and real-time feedback, resulting in fewer bugs and higher quality software releases.
      </p>
      <b>4. Scalability and Flexibility</b>:
      <p class="p">
        DevOps allows for easier scaling of applications and systems, making it easier to manage large infrastructure and adapt to changing business needs.
      </p>
      <b>5. Continuous Learning</b>:
      <p class="p">
        DevOps is constantly evolving with new tools, technologies, and methodologies, providing opportunities for continuous learning and improvement.
      </p>

      <h2>DevOps Tools and Practices</h2>
      <b>1. CI/CD Pipelines</b>:
      <p class="p">
        CI/CD pipelines automate the process of integrating and delivering code. Tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, and GitLab CI are commonly used to set up pipelines for continuous integration and delivery.
      </p>
      <b>2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</b>:
      <p class="p">
        Infrastructure as Code allows you to manage and provision infrastructure using code. Popular IaC tools include Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation.
      </p>
      <b>3. Containerization and Orchestration</b>:
      <p class="p">
        Containers like Docker allow developers to package applications with all their dependencies. Kubernetes is widely used for container orchestration to manage, deploy, and scale containerized applications.
      </p>
      <b>4. Monitoring and Logging</b>:
      <p class="p">
        Monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) help teams track performance, monitor system health, and troubleshoot issues.
      </p>
