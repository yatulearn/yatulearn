    <h1 class="h1">What is an Operating System (OS)?</h1>
    <br />
    <p class="p">
      An Operating System (OS) is the most critical software component on a
      computer or device, serving as an intermediary between the hardware and
      the user. It manages hardware resources, provides a user interface, and
      facilitates the execution of application software. The OS controls the way
      software interacts with hardware, ensures that processes are executed
      efficiently, and manages files, memory, and peripheral devices like
      printers and keyboards.<br />
    </p>
    <h2>Functions of an Operating System</h2>
    <br />

    <p class="p">
      <b>1. Process Management:</b> * The OS handles the creation, scheduling,
      and termination of processes. It manages CPU allocation to ensure that
      processes run smoothly without conflicts. <br />
      <b>2. Memory Management:</b>
      * The OS manages the computer's memory, allocating space for processes and
      ensuring that they do not interfere with each other. It handles memory
      allocation, deallocation, and swapping between RAM and disk storage.<br />
      <b>3. File System Management:</b>
      * The OS organizes and manages data on storage devices through a file
      system. It provides mechanisms for file creation, deletion, reading, and
      writing, as well as access control. <br />
      <b>4. Device Management:</b>
      * The OS manages input and output devices, such as keyboards, mice,
      printers, and storage devices. It provides device drivers that allow the
      hardware to communicate with software applications. <br />
      <b>5. Security and Access Control:</b>
      * The OS provides security mechanisms to protect the system from
      unauthorized access and threats. It manages user authentication,
      permissions, and encryption. <br />
      <b>6. User Interface:</b>
      * The OS offers a user interface, either command-line (CLI) or graphical
      (GUI), to interact with the system and execute commands. <br />
      <b>7. Networking:</b>
      * The OS provides networking capabilities that enable computers to
      communicate over a network. It handles network connections, data
      transmission, and communication protocols. <br />
      <b>8. Error Detection and Handling:</b>
      * The OS monitors the system for errors and takes appropriate actions to
      ensure the system remains stable and operational. <br />

    <h2>Types of Operating Systems</h2>
    <br /><br />
    <p class="p">
      <b>1. Batch Operating Systems:</b>
      * Definition: In batch systems, tasks or jobs are grouped together and
      processed sequentially without user interaction. These systems were common
      in early computing environments where resources were scarce. <br />
      * Examples: IBM's mainframe operating systems in the 1960s. <br />
      * Characteristics: Lack of direct user interaction, jobs processed in
      batches, efficient resource utilization. <br />
      <b>2. Time-Sharing Operating Systems:</b>
      * Definition: Time-sharing systems allow multiple users to share system
      resources simultaneously. The OS allocates a small time slice to each
      user, creating the illusion of concurrency.
      <br />* Examples: Unix, Multics. <br />
      * Characteristics: Multi-user environment, fast context switching,
      interactive user sessions. <br />
      <b>3. Distributed Operating Systems:</b>
      * Definition: Distributed systems manage a group of independent computers
      that appear to the user as a single cohesive system. The OS coordinates
      the distribution of tasks across multiple machines.
      <br />* Examples: Amoeba, Plan 9. <br />* Characteristics: Resource
      sharing, parallel processing, fault tolerance. <br />
      <b>4. Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS):</b>
      * Definition: RTOS are designed for systems that require precise timing
      and consistent response times. They are used in applications where timing
      is critical, such as embedded systems, industrial automation, and
      avionics.
      <br />* Examples: VxWorks, FreeRTOS, QNX. <br />* Characteristics:
      Deterministic behavior, high reliability, low latency. <br />
      <b>5. Embedded Operating Systems:</b>
      * Definition: Embedded systems are specialized OS designed to run on
      embedded hardware with limited resources. These systems are used in
      devices like routers, smart appliances, and automotive systems.
      <br />* Examples: Embedded Linux, Windows Embedded, FreeRTOS. <br />*
      Characteristics: Small footprint, real-time capabilities, highly
      specialized. <br /><b>6. Network Operating Systems (NOS):</b>
      * Definition: NOS are designed to manage network resources and enable
      communication between computers over a network. They provide services like
      file sharing, print services, and user management.
      <br />* Examples: Novell NetWare, Windows Server, Unix. <br />*
      Characteristics: Network-centric features, user and resource management,
      security. <br /><b>7. Mobile Operating Systems:</b>
      * Definition: Mobile OS are designed for smartphones, tablets, and other
      portable devices. They are optimized for touch interfaces, mobile
      connectivity, and app ecosystems.
      <br />* Examples: Android, iOS, Windows Phone. <br />* Characteristics:
      Touch-based interface, app-centric design, energy efficiency. <br /><b
        >8. Cloud Operating Systems:</b
      >
      * Definition: Cloud OS are designed to run and manage virtualized
      environments in the cloud. They provide the infrastructure for cloud
      computing, allowing users to run applications and store data over the
      internet.
      <br />* Examples: OpenStack, VMware vSphere. <br />* Characteristics:
      Virtualization, scalability, remote access. <br /><b
        >9. General-Purpose Operating Systems:</b
      >
      * Definition: These OS are designed for general use and can run a wide
      variety of applications, making them suitable for desktops, laptops, and
      servers.
      <br />* Examples: Windows, macOS, Linux. <br />* Characteristics:
      Versatility, user-friendly interfaces, broad hardware support.
