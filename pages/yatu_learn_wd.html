            Web Development refers to the process of creating, building, and
            maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It
            encompasses various aspects such as web design, web content development,
            client-side/server-side scripting, and network security configuration. Web
            development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain
            text to complex web-based internet applications, e-commerce platforms, and
            social networking services. It involves a combination of programming,
            design, and content creation skills.
