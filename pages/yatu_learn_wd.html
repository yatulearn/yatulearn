    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <div class="content-box">
    <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
    <p class="p">
      Web Development refers to the process of creating, building, and
      maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It
      encompasses various aspects such as web design, web content development,
      client-side/server-side scripting, and network security configuration. Web
      development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain
      text to complex web-based internet applications, e-commerce platforms, and
      social networking services. It involves a combination of programming,
      design, and content creation skills.
    </p>
    <h2>Types of Web Development and Developers</h2>
    <p class="p">
      Web development is typically divided into three main types, each focusing
      on different aspects of a website or web application:
    </p>
    <b>1. Front-End Development:</b>
    <p class="p">
      * What It Is: Front-end development, also known as client-side
      development, involves creating the visual elements of a website or web
      application that users interact with directly. This includes everything
      from the layout, design, and content to how a website behaves in response
      to user actions. <br />* Skills Required: HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
      responsive design, frameworks like React.js, Angular, or Vue.js, and
      version control/Git. <br />* Roadmap: <br />* Basics: Start with learning
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br />* Responsive Design: Understand how to
      create responsive layouts using CSS Flexbox and Grid. <br />* JavaScript
      Libraries/Frameworks: Learn popular libraries and frameworks like React.js
      or Vue.js. <br />* Build Projects: Create personal projects, like
      portfolios, simple games, or interactive websites. <br />* Version
      Control: Learn Git and GitHub to manage your code.
    </p>
    <b>2. Back-End Development:</b>
    <p class="p">
      * What It Is: Back-end development, or server-side development, focuses on
      what happens behind the scenes of a web application. It involves managing
      the server, database, and application logic that powers the front-end.
      <br />* Skills Required: Server, database, API, and backend logic
      management using languages like Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, or .NET,
      databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and knowledge of RESTful APIs.
      <br />* Roadmap: <br />* Programming Language: Learn a back-end language
      like Node.js, Python, or PHP. <br />* Databases: Understand relational
      (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and non-relational (MongoDB) databases. <br />* APIs:
      Learn how to create and consume RESTful APIs. <br />* Authentication:
      Understand how to implement user authentication and authorization. <br />*
      Server Management: Learn about server hosting, deployment, and scaling
      (using platforms like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean). <br />* Build
      Projects: Create projects like RESTful APIs, e-commerce sites, or content
      management systems.
    </p>
    <b>3. Full-Stack Development:</b>
    <p class="p">
      * What It Is: Full-stack development involves working on both the
      front-end and back-end portions of a web application. A full-stack
      developer has a comprehensive understanding of all aspects of web
      development and can build a complete web application from scratch. <br />*
      Skills Required: A combination of front-end and back-end skills, including
      knowledge of both client-side and server-side languages, databases, and
      version control. <br />* Roadmap: <br />* Learn Front-End Development:
      Follow the roadmap for front-end development. <br />* Learn Back-End
      Development: Follow the roadmap for back-end development. <br />* DevOps
      Basics: Understand the basics of DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud
      services. <br />* Build Full-Stack Projects: Create comprehensive projects
      that involve both front-end and back-end, like a social networking site,
      blogging platform, or online marketplace.
