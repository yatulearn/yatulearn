    <h2 class="dsa-heading">What is DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)?</h2>
    <p class="p">
      DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms. It's a fundamental concept
      in computer science and programming that deals with how data is organized,
      managed, and processed efficiently. <br /><br />
      1. Data Structures are the ways in which data is organized in memory to be
      used effectively. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues,
      trees, graphs, hash tables, etc. Each data structure is suited to specific
      kinds of applications, and understanding them allows you to choose the
      most efficient one for your task.
      <br /><br />

      2. Algorithms are the step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a
      problem or performing a task. They can be thought of as recipes that tell
      you how to manipulate data stored in data structures. Examples include
      searching algorithms (like binary search), sorting algorithms (like
      quicksort and mergesort), and graph traversal algorithms (like BFS and
      DFS). <br />
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="dsa-heading">Why DSA ?</h2>
    <h6>...</h6>
    <p class="p">
      1. Efficiency: In software development, efficiency is crucial. Whether
      it's optimizing the load time of a website, reducing the response time of
      an app, or managing large-scale data, DSA provides the tools to build
      software that is fast and efficient. <br />
      <br />
      2. Problem-Solving: DSA enhances problem-solving skills. Understanding
      various data structures and algorithms allows you to approach problems
      logically and find optimized solutions, which is essential in competitive
      programming and coding interviews. <br />
      <br />
      3. Coding Interviews: Companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and
      Microsoft heavily emphasize DSA in their technical interviews. A strong
      grasp of DSA can significantly increase your chances of acing these
      interviews and landing a job at top tech companies. <br />
      <br />
      4. Foundational Knowledge: DSA forms the foundation of computer science.
      Whether you're interested in AI, machine learning, game development, or
      system programming, a strong understanding of DSA is essential. <br />
