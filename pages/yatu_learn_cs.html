    <h2>What is Cyber Security?</h2>
    <br />
    <p class="p">
      Cyber Security is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data
      from digital attacks, unauthorized access, or damage. It encompasses a
      range of processes, technologies, and practices designed to secure
      computers, networks, and data from malicious attacks, damage, or
      unauthorized access. In today's digital world, where almost everything is
      interconnected, cyber security is vital for protecting sensitive
      information, maintaining the integrity of systems, and ensuring the
      availability of critical services. Cyber security involves multiple layers
      of defense, spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that
      one intends to keep safe. There are various types of cyber threats,
      including hacking, malware, phishing, ransomware, and social engineering,
      each requiring specific countermeasures.
