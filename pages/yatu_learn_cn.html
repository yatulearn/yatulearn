    <h2>What is a Computer Network and Networking?</h2>
    <h6>...</h6>
    <h6>...</h6>
    <p class="p">
      Computer Network refers to a group of interconnected computers and other
      devices that share resources and information. These devices, which include
      computers, servers, routers, switches, and more, are connected through
      communication channels, allowing them to exchange data and resources such
      as files, printers, and internet connections. Networking is the practice
      of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and
      information efficiently. It involves the design, implementation, and
      management of networks to ensure they operate smoothly, securely, and
      reliably. Networking covers various aspects, such as network protocols,
      topology, hardware, software, and security measures.

    <h2>Types of Computer Networks</h2>
    <h6>...</h6>
    <h6>...</h6>
    <p class="p">
      Computer networks can be classified based on their size, scope, and
      purpose: <br /><br />
      <b>1. Personal Area Network (PAN):</b> <br /><br />
      * Definition: A PAN is a small network, typically covering a single
      person's workspace. It involves connecting personal devices like
      smartphones, laptops, tablets, and printers within a limited range,
      usually within a few meters.
      <br />* Examples: Bluetooth connections between a smartphone and a
      headset, or a Wi-Fi connection between a laptop and a printer.
      <br /><br />
      <b>2. Local Area Network (LAN):</b> <br /><br />
      * Definition: A LAN is a network that connects devices within a limited
      geographical area, such as a home, office, or campus. LANs are commonly
      used for sharing resources like files, printers, and internet connections
      among multiple devices. * Examples: Office networks, home networks, school
      networks. <br />
      * Hardware: Routers, switches, Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi access points.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):</b><br /><br />
      * Definition: A MAN covers a larger area than a LAN, typically a city or a
      large campus. It connects multiple LANs within a metropolitan area,
      allowing them to communicate and share resources. <br />
      * Examples: City-wide networks for government agencies, large university
      campuses. <br />
      * Hardware: Routers, switches, optical fibers, wireless communication
      links. <br />
      <br />
      <b>4. Wide Area Network (WAN):</b><br /><br />
      * Definition: A WAN spans a large geographical area, often connecting
      multiple LANs and MANs. WANs can cover cities, countries, or even
      continents, making them suitable for organizations with multiple branches
      or offices.
      <br />
      * Examples: The internet, corporate networks connecting offices in
      different locations. <br />
      * Hardware: Routers, modems, leased lines, satellite communication links.
      <br /><br />
      <b>5. Campus Area Network (CAN):</b><br /><br />
      * Definition: A CAN is a type of network that connects multiple LANs
      within a specific campus or organization, such as a university, hospital,
      or corporate complex. CANs are larger than a LAN but smaller than a MAN.
      <br />
      * Examples: Networks in university campuses, corporate campuses,
      industrial complexes. <br />
      * Hardware: Switches, routers, fiber optics, wireless access points.
      <br /><br />
      <b>6. Storage Area Network (SAN):</b><br /><br />
      * Definition: A SAN is a specialized network that provides access to
      consolidated, block-level data storage. SANs are designed to handle large
      amounts of data and are used primarily in enterprise environments to
      enhance storage devices' performance and availability. * Examples:
      Enterprise data centers, cloud storage providers. <br />
      * Hardware: Fiber Channel, Ethernet, storage arrays, switches. <br />
      <b>7. Virtual Private Network (VPN):</b> <br />
      <br />
      * Definition: A VPN allows secure communication over a public network,
      such as the internet, by creating an encrypted tunnel between the user's
      device and the VPN server. VPNs are used to enhance security and privacy,
      especially for remote workers. * Examples: Remote access to corporate
      networks, secure browsing on public Wi-Fi. <br />
      * Software: VPN client software, VPN servers, encryption protocols. <br />
