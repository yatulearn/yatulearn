    <h2>What is DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)?</h2>
    <p class="p">DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms. It's a fundamental concept in computer science and programming
        that deals with how data is organized, managed, and processed efficiently. <br><br>
        1. Data Structures are the ways in which data is organized in memory to be used effectively. Examples include
        arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, etc. Each data structure is suited to specific
        kinds of applications, and understanding them allows you to choose the most efficient one for your task.
        <br><br>

        2. Algorithms are the step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem or performing a task. They can
        be thought of as recipes that tell you how to manipulate data stored in data structures. Examples include
        searching algorithms (like binary search), sorting algorithms (like quicksort and mergesort), and graph
        traversal algorithms (like BFS and DFS). <br>
    </p><br>
    <h2>Why DSA ?</h2>
    <h6>...</h6>
    <p class="p">1. Efficiency: In software development, efficiency is crucial. Whether it's optimizing the load time of a
        website, reducing the response time of an app, or managing large-scale data, DSA provides the tools to build
        software that is fast and efficient. <br>
        <br>
        2. Problem-Solving: DSA enhances problem-solving skills. Understanding various data structures and algorithms
        allows you to approach problems logically and find optimized solutions, which is essential in competitive
        programming and coding interviews. <br>
        <br>
        3. Coding Interviews: Companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft heavily emphasize DSA in their
        technical interviews. A strong grasp of DSA can significantly increase your chances of acing these interviews
        and landing a job at top tech companies. <br>
        <br>
        4. Foundational Knowledge: DSA forms the foundation of computer science. Whether you're interested in AI,
        machine learning, game development, or system programming, a strong understanding of DSA is essential. <br>
